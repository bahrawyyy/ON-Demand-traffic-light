# ON-Demand-traffic-light  
2nd project of FWD professional, It consists of two modes : normal and pedestrian The system runs on normal mode until a pedestrian presses the button, then it will switch to pedestrian mode based on the current status of LEDs in normal mode

## Functionality
The ON-Demand Traffic Light operates as follows:  

- Normal Mode: The traffic light system runs in the normal mode by default. It controls the traffic flow based on pre-defined timing patterns for each signal.
- Pedestrian Mode: When a pedestrian presses the button, the system switches to the pedestrian mode. The timing of the pedestrian signals is dynamically adjusted based on the current status of LEDs in the normal mode. This ensures a smooth transition and avoids unnecessary traffic disruptions.
